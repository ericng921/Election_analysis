## Overview of Election Audit
### Purpose of the analysis

In the module We've helped Seth and Tom with some information from the election dataset: the total votes, number of votes for each candidate, the Winner of the election etc. We are going to have a more in-depth analysis for the election audit result.

In this challenge, we need to find the voter turnout for each county, the percentage of votes from each county out of the total count, and the county with the highest turnout. When we get this information, we will have a bigger picture of the election results and also a better idea of how many voters for each county.

In the analysis we had created some variables in list and dictionary for the candidate, voters, and county, and using for loop and if statement to get the break down of election results and save it in a text file.

## Election-Audit Summary

After running the script, we have a breakdown of the Election Results with the voting information in different County and Candidates. We will use the information to analyze the relationship between the candidates, county and the number of votes.

Especially it is important to know the number of votes in each county. For example, for the lower voting county we can encourage the people to go vote and allocate more resources in these counties. Also, we can have some modifications with the script to have other in-depth analysis for other elections.

- Two examples of how the modified script to be used for other elections:

1. We can find how many votes and percentage for each candidate in each county by adding another If statement, so that we will know how the candidate perform in the county and which country the candidate gets most voter.

2. The os path can be modified for other csv file and the variable's name can be modified as well, so that we can use the script for other elections such as federal election.
